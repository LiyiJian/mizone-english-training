      'We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to build a complete picture of our consumer.',
      'Qualitative methods like focus groups and ethnographic studies help us understand the "why" behind consumer behavior.',
      'Quantitative surveys and brand tracking studies give us statistically reliable data on awareness, preference, and purchase intent.',
      'One of the most powerful insights we uncovered was through in-home usage tests — consumers were adding our electrolyte drink to their morning routine, not just post-workout.',
      'This behavioral insight completely shifted our communication strategy: we moved from a sports recovery message to an everyday hydration platform.',
      'The key is translating raw data into a human truth — a single, compelling insight that inspires the entire brand team.',
      'A great consumer insight should be surprising, relevant, and actionable — it should make you say: "I never thought of it that way, but it\'s so true."'

This challenges our current "sports hydration" narrative and reveals a significant unmet opportunity to position Mizone as a "workday wellness" companion.\n\nStrategic Implication: We may be underserving the office consumption occasion. I propose we explore communications centered on "mental focus and physical refresh for your busiest hours."\n\nRequested Actions:\n- R&D: Assess whether current flavors and formats are optimized for office consumption (e.g., smaller sizes, quieter packaging).\n- Sales: Evaluate distribution opportunities in corporate canteens and office vending channels.\n- Creative Agency: Please review campaign briefs in light of this finding before finalizing Q3 creative.\n\nI\'d like to convene a 60-minute cross-functional workshop on [Date] to align on next steps. Please reply with your availability by [Date].\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity to unlock a new growth lever for the brand. Thank you for your partnership.\n\nBest regards,\nXueyan Xu',
