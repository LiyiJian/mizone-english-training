    text: [
      'Launching a new product is one of the most complex and high-stakes activities in brand management — the success window is narrow and the cost of failure is high.',
      'Our go-to-market strategy for the new Mizone wellness variant was built around four pillars: distribution readiness, consumer awareness, trial generation, and repeat purchase.',
      'Distribution readiness came first — we set a target of 40,000 points of distribution within the first three months, with priority given to modern trade and health-focused specialty channels.',
      'For consumer awareness, we led with a Douyin-first approach: a teaser campaign featuring fitness micro-KOLs that launched two weeks before the product hit shelves.',
      'Trial generation was driven through in-store sampling events at 200 key outlets, a digital coupon program in partnership with Meituan, and a first-purchase gift-with-purchase offer.',
      'Repeat purchase is the hardest challenge for any new product — our retention strategy included a WeChat loyalty program, personalized reorder reminders, and a subscription model piloted on JD.com.',
      'In the first four months, the new variant achieved 85% of its distribution target, a 22% trial rate among target consumers, and a 38% repeat purchase rate — beating our launch benchmarks.',
      'The most critical lesson: a great product with poor in-store execution is invisible. Distribution and shelving are the non-negotiable foundations of any successful launch.'

      'Distribution readiness is the non-negotiable foundation — the most brilliant campaign is wasted if consumers cannot find the product when they want to buy it.',
      'To drive trial, I would invest in a combination of physical sampling at high-traffic touchpoints and digital incentives — coupons, first-purchase rebates, and influencer exclusive codes.',

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: 'PODs (Points of Distribution) measure how widely available a product is — how many stores carry it. Higher PODs = broader availability = more purchase opportunities.'

          'The percentage of the target consumer population who has purchased the product at least once',

        answer: 'repeat',
        explanation: '"Repeat purchase rate" is the critical indicator of product satisfaction and long-term commercial viability — it shows whether trial converts to habit.'
