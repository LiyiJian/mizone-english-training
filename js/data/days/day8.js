      'In FMCG, up to 70% of purchase decisions are made at the point of sale — which means winning in-store is just as important as winning on TV or social media.',
      'Trade marketing is the discipline that connects brand strategy with in-store execution — ensuring the right product is in the right place, at the right price, with the right visibility.',
      'Our channel strategy segmented outlets into three tiers: priority accounts like hypermarkets and convenience chain flagships, standard accounts like neighborhood supermarkets, and value accounts like wet markets.',
      'For priority accounts, we invested in premium shelf placement — eye-level positioning, branded coolers, and large-format secondary displays near checkout.',
      'We also ran a quarterly in-store activation calendar — timed to coincide with key consumption occasions like summer, sports season, and back-to-school.',
      'One of our most effective trade marketing tools was a joint business planning session with our top three retail partners, where we co-developed customized promotional calendars aligned with their traffic peaks.',
      'Measuring trade marketing effectiveness requires a combination of sell-in data, sell-through data, and regular retail audit scores across our key metrics.',
      'The brands that win in trade marketing are those that treat retailers as strategic partners — understanding their business needs, not just pushing volume onto their shelves.'

      '贸易营销是将品牌战略与店内执行相连接的学科——确保正确的产品出现在正确的地点、以正确的价格、拥有正确的能见度。',
      '我们的渠道策略将零售网点分为三层：优先客户（如大卖场和便利连锁旗舰店）、标准客户（如社区超市）、价值客户（如农贸市场）。',
      '对于优先客户，我们投资于优质货架位置——视线水平陈列、品牌冷柜，以及收银台附近的大型二级陈列。',
      '我们还制定了季度店内激活日历——时间与主要消费场景吻合，如夏季、运动季和开学季。',
      '我们最有效的贸易营销工具之一是与前三大零售合作伙伴的联合生意计划会议，我们共同制定了与其客流高峰对齐的定制促销日历。',

        answer: 1,
        explanation: '"Sell-through" measures how much product consumers actually purchase from shelves. "Sell-in" measures what the brand ships to the retailer — high sell-in with low sell-through means overstock and poor promotion effectiveness.',
        explanationZh: '"Sell-through"（动销）衡量消费者实际从货架购买了多少。"Sell-in"（进货）衡量品牌向零售商发货多少——进货高但动销低意味着积压和促销效果差。'
