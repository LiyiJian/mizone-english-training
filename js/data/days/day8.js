    title: 'Winning at the Point of Sale — Trade Marketing in FMCG',
    text: [
      'In FMCG, up to 70% of purchase decisions are made at the point of sale — which means winning in-store is just as important as winning on TV or social media.',
      'Trade marketing is the discipline that connects brand strategy with in-store execution — ensuring the right product is in the right place, at the right price, with the right visibility.',
      'Our channel strategy segmented outlets into three tiers: priority accounts like hypermarkets and convenience chain flagships, standard accounts like neighborhood supermarkets, and value accounts like wet markets.',
      'For priority accounts, we invested in premium shelf placement — eye-level positioning, branded coolers, and large-format secondary displays near checkout.',
      'We also ran a quarterly in-store activation calendar — timed to coincide with key consumption occasions like summer, sports season, and back-to-school.',
      'One of our most effective trade marketing tools was a joint business planning session with our top three retail partners, where we co-developed customized promotional calendars aligned with their traffic peaks.',
      'Measuring trade marketing effectiveness requires a combination of sell-in data, sell-through data, and regular retail audit scores across our key metrics.',
      'The brands that win in trade marketing are those that treat retailers as strategic partners — understanding their business needs, not just pushing volume onto their shelves.'

  quiz: {
    questions: [
      {
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'What does "sell-through" measure in trade marketing?',
        options: [
          'The amount of product sold by the brand to the retailer (brand to store)',
          'The amount of product sold by the retailer to end consumers (store to shopper)',
          'The total number of stores carrying the product',
          'The promotional discount offered to retailers'
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: '"Sell-through" measures how much product consumers actually purchase from shelves. "Sell-in" measures what the brand ships to the retailer — high sell-in with low sell-through means overstock and poor promotion effectiveness.'
      },
      {
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'What is a "secondary display" in trade marketing?',
        options: [
          'The brand\'s second-most important product variant',
          'An additional product placement outside the main shelf, such as an end-cap or checkout display',
          'A display screen showing digital advertising',
          'A product placement in a secondary-tier city store'
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: 'Secondary displays give brands extra shelf presence beyond their main category aisle — end-caps, island displays, and checkout areas drive impulse purchase.'

        question: 'A collaborative planning session between a brand and its retail partner to align on annual sales targets and promotional calendars is called ________ business planning.',
        answer: 'joint',
        explanation: '"Joint business planning" (JBP) is a strategic alignment tool where brands and retailers co-develop annual commercial plans, sharing data and co-investing in growth.'

      {
        type: 'mcq',

        corrected: 'The brand should be placed at eye-level shelves to ensure maximum visibility.',
        answer: 'The brand should be placed at eye-level shelves to ensure maximum visibility.',
