    title: 'A Brand Manager\'s Case Study: Reversing Declining Market Share',
    text: [
      'I\'d like to share a case study from my previous role that I believe demonstrates my approach to brand management under pressure.',
      'The situation was serious: our flagship product had lost 4 percentage points of market share over 18 months, and retailer confidence was beginning to waver.',
      'My task as the incoming Brand Manager was to diagnose the root cause, develop a recovery strategy, and reverse the trend within 12 months — a very tight timeline.',
      'Through consumer research and retail audits, I identified three root causes: a pricing gap against new entrants, outdated packaging, and a media strategy skewed toward older consumers.',
      'My actions involved three parallel workstreams: a packaging redesign to modernize the brand\'s visual identity, a price architecture review to close the competitive gap, and a digital media pivot targeting 18-to-30-year-olds.',
      'I led a cross-functional team of eight across marketing, sales, R&D, and finance, with weekly governance meetings to keep all workstreams on track.',
      'The results exceeded our expectations: within 12 months, we recovered 3.2 percentage points of market share, increased household penetration by 8%, and grew e-commerce revenue by 45%.',
      'The key learning was that brand recovery requires simultaneous action across multiple levers — there is rarely a single silver bullet.'
