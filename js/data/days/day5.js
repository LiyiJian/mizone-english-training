      'Digital is no longer just a channel — for many FMCG brands today, it is the primary battleground for consumer attention and brand preference.',
      'Our digital strategy for the brand rested on three pillars: content excellence, community building, and performance-driven media.',
      'On Douyin, we shifted from brand-produced content to a co-creation model with micro and nano KOLs — creators with 10,000 to 100,000 followers who deliver higher engagement rates than celebrity endorsers.',
      'The authenticity of micro-KOL content resonated far better with Gen Z consumers, who are increasingly skeptical of polished, brand-produced advertising.',
      'We also built a WeChat CRM ecosystem — loyalty points, personalized content, and exclusive offers — to deepen our relationship with high-frequency buyers.',
      'On the performance side, we used programmatic advertising to serve personalized ads based on behavioral signals: purchase history, content consumption, and location data.',
      'One critical lesson: digital channels require daily monitoring and rapid optimization — a creative that works on day one may become stale by day seven.',
      'By the end of the quarter, our social content had generated 120 million impressions, a 4.2% engagement rate, and a 15% uplift in e-commerce conversion.'
