    title: 'Aligning a Cross-Functional Team Around a Brand Campaign',
    text: [
      'Brand managers rarely have direct authority over all the functions they need to succeed — which makes cross-functional leadership and stakeholder management essential skills.',
      'For our annual brand campaign, I was responsible for aligning R&D, finance, sales, supply chain, and two external agencies — none of whom reported to me.',
      'My approach was to build alignment in three stages: first, secure senior sponsorship from the Marketing Director to give the project organizational weight; second, co-create the project charter with all functions so everyone felt ownership; and third, establish a clear governance cadence — weekly check-ins and bi-weekly steering meetings.',
      'The most challenging relationship was with the finance team, who were skeptical of the campaign\'s ROI projections. I addressed this by involving their senior analyst in the marketing mix modeling process — turning a gatekeeper into an advocate.',
      'With the sales team, the challenge was different: they felt the campaign was too brand-focused and not enough about driving immediate sell-in. I resolved this by adding a trade-specific activation layer to the plan that directly supported their Q3 push.',
      'With external agencies, I held a joint briefing session rather than briefing each separately — this prevented misalignment and built cross-agency chemistry from day one.',
      'The campaign delivered on all its KPIs, but the bigger win was organizational: three functions that had historically worked in silos built lasting collaborative relationships through this project.',
      'In large organizations, the brand manager\'s greatest leverage is not their budget or their title — it is their ability to bring people together around a shared ambition.'

      '品牌经理很少对他们成功所需的所有职能拥有直接权力——这使得跨职能领导和利益相关者管理成为必备技能。',
      '对于我们的年度品牌活动，我负责协调研发、财务、销售、供应链和两家外部代理公司——他们没有一个向我汇报。',
      '我的方法是分三个阶段建立一致性：首先，从营销总监那里获得高层支持，为项目赋予组织权重；其次，与所有职能共同创建项目章程，让每个人都感到有主人翁意识；第三，建立清晰的治理节奏——每周例会和每两周一次的指导会议。',
      '最具挑战性的关系是与财务团队，他们对活动的ROI预测持怀疑态度。我的解决方案是让他们的高级分析师参与营销组合建模过程——将守门人变成倡导者。',
      '与销售团队的挑战则不同：他们感觉活动过于注重品牌而不够注重推动立即的销售进货。我通过在计划中增加一个直接支持他们第三季度推进的渠道专属激活层来解决这个问题。',
      '与外部代理公司合作时，我举行了一个联合简报会，而不是分别向每家公司简报——这从一开始就防止了错位并建立了跨代理公司的化学反应。',
      '活动在所有KPI上都超额完成，但更大的胜利是组织层面的：三个历史上各自为政的职能通过这个项目建立了持久的协作关系。',
      '在大型组织中，品牌经理最大的杠杆不是他们的预算或头衔——而是他们将人们团结在共同愿景周围的能力。'
