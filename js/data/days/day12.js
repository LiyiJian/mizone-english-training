    title: 'Aligning a Cross-Functional Team Around a Brand Campaign',
    text: [
      'Brand managers rarely have direct authority over all the functions they need to succeed — which makes cross-functional leadership and stakeholder management essential skills.',
      'For our annual brand campaign, I was responsible for aligning R&D, finance, sales, supply chain, and two external agencies — none of whom reported to me.',
      'My approach was to build alignment in three stages: first, secure senior sponsorship from the Marketing Director to give the project organizational weight; second, co-create the project charter with all functions so everyone felt ownership; and third, establish a clear governance cadence — weekly check-ins and bi-weekly steering meetings.',
      'The most challenging relationship was with the finance team, who were skeptical of the campaign\'s ROI projections. I addressed this by involving their senior analyst in the marketing mix modeling process — turning a gatekeeper into an advocate.',
      'With the sales team, the challenge was different: they felt the campaign was too brand-focused and not enough about driving immediate sell-in. I resolved this by adding a trade-specific activation layer to the plan that directly supported their Q3 push.',
      'With external agencies, I held a joint briefing session rather than briefing each separately — this prevented misalignment and built cross-agency chemistry from day one.',
      'The campaign delivered on all its KPIs, but the bigger win was organizational: three functions that had historically worked in silos built lasting collaborative relationships through this project.',
      'In large organizations, the brand manager\'s greatest leverage is not their budget or their title — it is their ability to bring people together around a shared ambition.'
