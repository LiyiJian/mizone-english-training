      'Every marketing budget is an investment hypothesis — the CFO is essentially asking: if we give you this money, what return can the business expect?',
      'Gone are the days when brand managers could justify budgets with vague references to brand equity and awareness. Today, every dollar must be accountable.',
      'We measure marketing ROI across two dimensions: short-term commercial return — incremental revenue and volume driven directly by the campaign — and long-term brand equity return, measured through brand tracking.',
      'For our last major campaign, we used a marketing mix modeling approach to isolate the sales contribution of each channel — TV, digital, trade, and sampling.',
      'The model showed that digital channels generated a 3.2x return on ad spend, while sampling events drove the highest trial conversion rate at 18%.',
      'Armed with these numbers, I was able to make a data-driven case to redirect 20% of our TV budget into digital and sampling in the following year.',
      'Budget management is not just about spending wisely — it\'s about building the credibility to ask for more. Every campaign result you can quantify is an argument for future investment.',
      'The brand managers who thrive are those who speak the language of the CFO: incremental revenue, payback period, and return on ad spend — not just reach and engagement.'

        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: 'ROAS = Return on Advertising Spend. If you spend RMB 1M and generate RMB 3.2M in revenue, your ROAS is 3.2x. It\'s the primary efficiency metric for marketing investment.'
