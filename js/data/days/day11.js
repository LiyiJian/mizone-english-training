    title: 'Staying Ahead of the Competition — Market Intelligence in Action',
    text: [
      'In a fast-moving market like functional beverages, the competitive landscape can shift dramatically within a single quarter — a brand that ignores its competitors does so at its own peril.',
      'We built a competitive intelligence system that monitored three layers: market structure data from Nielsen, social listening for emerging trends and competitor brand sentiment, and field intelligence from our sales team.',
      'One of our most valuable intelligence sources was actually our own sales representatives — they saw new product placements, price changes, and promotional activities before any syndicated data captured it.',
      'On a quarterly basis, we conducted a full competitor brand audit: reviewing their advertising campaigns, social content strategy, media spend estimates, and distribution footprint.',
      'A key competitive insight we uncovered was that our primary competitor was over-investing in the 16–22 age group while underinvesting in 26–35 professional consumers — precisely where our data showed the highest growth potential.',
      'We also used share of voice analysis to track our brand\'s share of online conversation relative to competitors — a strong leading indicator of future market share movement.',
      'Our competitive strategy was not to copy the market leader, but to find the spaces where they were not playing and win there decisively.',
      'The output of our quarterly competitive review was a one-page competitive battlecard that every sales rep carried — translated competitor intelligence into actionable selling ammunition.'

    reference: 'Subject: Q2 Competitive Intelligence Review — 3 Key Findings & Recommended Actions\n\nHi team,\n\nBelow is our Q2 Competitive Landscape Review for Mizone. Three developments require your attention:\n\n1. Competitor A — Gen Z Entry: Competitor A launched a sugar-free functional variant in May targeting Gen Z (16–24), with strong early CVS trial data. This directly challenges our Q3 Gen Z growth ambitions.\n\n2. Competitor B — Douyin Surge: Estimated Douyin spend increased ~40% in Q2 with heavy investment in fitness and productivity content. Mizone\'s Douyin share of voice has consequently softened.\n\n3. Mizone Share of Voice Decline: Our digital SOV dropped from 31% to 28% this quarter — a signal we need to increase content frequency and quality.\n\nRecommended Responses:\n• Accelerate Gen Z content plan on Douyin with 20+ micro-KOL activations in Q3.\n• Differentiate through "workday wellness" positioning — a territory neither competitor currently occupies.\n• Activate WeChat community for UGC to build organic SOV.\n\nFull competitive battlecard will be presented at our team meeting on [Date]. Please review the attached data deck.\n\nBest,\nXueyan Xu | Brand Manager, Mizone'
