      'When we decided to reposition our sports drink, the first question we asked was: who is our core consumer, and what unmet need are we solving?',
      'Our consumer research revealed a gap in the market — health-conscious millennials wanted functional hydration without artificial ingredients.',
      'From a product perspective, we reformulated with natural electrolytes, removed artificial colors, and introduced a cleaner label design.',
      'On pricing, we moved from a budget-tier position to a premium-accessible price point, which supported the brand\'s new health-oriented image.',
      'For distribution, we expanded beyond traditional convenience stores into gyms, yoga studios, and health food chains — channels where our target consumer already shops.',
      'Our promotional strategy shifted heavily toward digital — partnering with fitness KOLs on social platforms and running a "Hydrate Naturally" content campaign.',
      'The repositioning took 18 months from insight to execution, involving cross-functional teams across marketing, R&D, supply chain, and sales.',
      'The result was a 31% increase in brand preference among the 18–35 age group and a meaningful share gain in the premium sports drink segment.'

      '从产品角度来看，我们用天然电解质重新配方，去除了人工色素，并推出了更简洁的标签设计。',
