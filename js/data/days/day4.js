      'A successful integrated marketing campaign starts with a crystal-clear objective — awareness, trial, loyalty, or all three at different stages.',
      'Before briefing the agency, you need to define your target audience with precision: demographics, psychographics, media consumption habits, and purchase triggers.',
      'The campaign brief is the most important document in the process — a poorly written brief leads to off-strategy creative, wasted budget, and missed deadlines.',
      'In an integrated campaign, every touchpoint — TV, digital, out-of-home, in-store — must carry the same brand story, just adapted for the medium.',
      'We typically use a "hero, hub, hygiene" content framework: hero content drives mass awareness, hub content deepens engagement, and hygiene content answers specific consumer questions.',
      'Measurement must be built into the campaign from day one — KPIs should be defined before the campaign launches, not after.',
      'For our last summer campaign, we ran a 12-week phased approach: two weeks of teaser, six weeks of launch, and four weeks of sustain with personalized retargeting.',
      'Post-campaign analysis showed that the digital-first channels delivered 40% lower cost per engagement compared to traditional media, which directly informed our next budget allocation.'
