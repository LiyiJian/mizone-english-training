    title: 'A Senior Brand Manager\'s Interview — Full Q&A Walkthrough',
    text: [
      'Interviewer: Thank you for coming in today. Let\'s begin — can you walk me through your background and why you\'re interested in the Mizone Brand Manager role?',
      'Candidate: Absolutely. I\'m a brand marketer with seven years of experience in FMCG — specifically in the beverage sector. Over that time I\'ve built expertise across the full brand management cycle: consumer insight, positioning, integrated campaigns, and trade marketing. What draws me to Mizone specifically is its unique opportunity to connect health and hydration in the daily lives of Chinese consumers — a mission I\'m genuinely passionate about.',
      'Interviewer: Tell me about a brand challenge you faced and how you resolved it.',
      'Candidate: Certainly. Situation: I joined a brand that had lost 4 points of market share over 18 months. Task: I was brought in to diagnose the root cause and lead a recovery strategy within 12 months. Action: I ran a rigorous root-cause analysis — retail audits and consumer research revealed three issues: outdated packaging, a competitive pricing gap, and media skewed toward older consumers. I led three parallel workstreams to address each simultaneously. Result: We recovered 3.2 percentage points of share, grew household penetration by 8%, and increased e-commerce revenue by 45%.',
      'Interviewer: How do you approach digital marketing for a beverage brand?',
      'Candidate: My philosophy is that digital is not just a channel — it\'s where brand relevance is built in real time. For a brand like Mizone, I\'d prioritize Douyin for awareness through micro-KOL co-creation, Xiaohongshu for brand aspiration and discovery, and WeChat for CRM and loyalty. I\'d measure success through engagement rate, share of voice, and ultimately e-commerce conversion — and I\'d optimize weekly, not quarterly.',
      'Interviewer: What would be your first 90 days as Mizone Brand Manager?',
      'Candidate: My first priority would be listening and learning. Week one: deep-dive consumer research review and team 1-on-1s. Weeks two to four: retail audit, competitive landscape analysis, and agency relationship building. By day 60, I\'d present a consumer insight-based strategic audit to senior leadership. By day 90, I\'d have a prioritized H2 action plan ready for approval.',
      'Interviewer: How do you prioritize when you have multiple competing demands?',
      'Candidate: I use two filters: strategic impact — does this move the needle on our most important brand KPI? And urgency — is there a genuine time-sensitive consequence of inaction? Tasks that are both high-impact and urgent go first. For everything else, I delegate or reschedule. I also protect deep-work time for strategic thinking — reactive work will always expand to fill the calendar unless you guard your time actively.'

      '面试官：感谢您今天的到来。让我们开始——您能介绍一下您的背景以及您为什么对脉动品牌经理一职感兴趣吗？',
      '候选人：当然。我是一名在快消品领域拥有七年经验的品牌营销人——尤其是在饮料行业。在此期间，我积累了品牌管理全周期的专业知识：消费者洞察、定位、整合营销活动和渠道营销。特别吸引我关注脉动的是其独特机遇——将健康与补水融入中国消费者的日常生活——这是我真正热爱的使命。',
      '面试官：请告诉我您面临的一个品牌挑战以及您是如何解决的。',
      '候选人：当然。情境：我加入了一个在18个月内损失了4个市场份额点的品牌。任务：我被引入以在12个月内诊断根本原因并领导复苏战略。行动：我进行了严格的根本原因分析——零售审计和消费者研究揭示了三个问题：过时的包装、竞争性价格差距，以及偏向老年消费者的媒体。我领导了三个并行工作流来同时解决每个问题。结果：我们恢复了3.2个市场份额百分点，家庭渗透率增长了8%，电商收入增加了45%。',
      '面试官：您如何处理饮料品牌的数字营销？',
      '候选人：我的理念是数字不仅仅是一个渠道——它是品牌相关性实时构建的地方。对于像脉动这样的品牌，我会优先考虑抖音（通过微型KOL共创来提升知名度）、小红书（品牌愿景和发现）和微信（CRM和忠诚度）。我会通过互动率、声量份额以及最终的电商转化来衡量成功——并且每周而非每季度优化。',
      '面试官：作为脉动品牌经理，您的头90天会是什么样子？',
      '候选人：我的第一优先级是倾听和学习。第一周：深入研究消费者研究报告和与团队成员进行一对一会议。第二到第四周：零售审计、竞争格局分析和代理公司关系建立。到第60天，我会向高层领导提交基于消费者洞察的战略审计。到第90天，我会准备好一份有优先级的下半年行动计划供批准。',
      '面试官：当您有多个相互竞争的需求时，您如何确定优先级？',
      '候选人：我使用两个过滤器：战略影响——这是否推动我们最重要品牌KPI的指针？以及紧迫性——不采取行动是否有真正的时间敏感后果？既高影响又紧迫的任务优先处理。其他所有事情，我要么委派要么重新安排。我还保护深度工作时间用于战略思考——除非你主动守护时间，否则响应性工作总会填满日历。'
