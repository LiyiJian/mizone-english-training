    title: 'A Senior Brand Manager\'s Interview — Full Q&A Walkthrough',
    text: [
      'Interviewer: Thank you for coming in today. Let\'s begin — can you walk me through your background and why you\'re interested in the Mizone Brand Manager role?',
      'Candidate: Absolutely. I\'m a brand marketer with seven years of experience in FMCG — specifically in the beverage sector. Over that time I\'ve built expertise across the full brand management cycle: consumer insight, positioning, integrated campaigns, and trade marketing. What draws me to Mizone specifically is its unique opportunity to connect health and hydration in the daily lives of Chinese consumers — a mission I\'m genuinely passionate about.',
      'Interviewer: Tell me about a brand challenge you faced and how you resolved it.',
      'Candidate: Certainly. Situation: I joined a brand that had lost 4 points of market share over 18 months. Task: I was brought in to diagnose the root cause and lead a recovery strategy within 12 months. Action: I ran a rigorous root-cause analysis — retail audits and consumer research revealed three issues: outdated packaging, a competitive pricing gap, and media skewed toward older consumers. I led three parallel workstreams to address each simultaneously. Result: We recovered 3.2 percentage points of share, grew household penetration by 8%, and increased e-commerce revenue by 45%.',
      'Interviewer: How do you approach digital marketing for a beverage brand?',
      'Candidate: My philosophy is that digital is not just a channel — it\'s where brand relevance is built in real time. For a brand like Mizone, I\'d prioritize Douyin for awareness through micro-KOL co-creation, Xiaohongshu for brand aspiration and discovery, and WeChat for CRM and loyalty. I\'d measure success through engagement rate, share of voice, and ultimately e-commerce conversion — and I\'d optimize weekly, not quarterly.',
      'Interviewer: What would be your first 90 days as Mizone Brand Manager?',
      'Candidate: My first priority would be listening and learning. Week one: deep-dive consumer research review and team 1-on-1s. Weeks two to four: retail audit, competitive landscape analysis, and agency relationship building. By day 60, I\'d present a consumer insight-based strategic audit to senior leadership. By day 90, I\'d have a prioritized H2 action plan ready for approval.',
      'Interviewer: How do you prioritize when you have multiple competing demands?',
      'Candidate: I use two filters: strategic impact — does this move the needle on our most important brand KPI? And urgency — is there a genuine time-sensitive consequence of inaction? Tasks that are both high-impact and urgent go first. For everything else, I delegate or reschedule. I also protect deep-work time for strategic thinking — reactive work will always expand to fill the calendar unless you guard your time actively.'
