    title: 'Presenting a Marketing Strategy Using the SCR Framework',
    text: [
      'The SCR framework — Situation, Complication, Resolution — is the gold standard for structured business presentations because it mirrors how executives actually think.',
      'In the Situation section, you establish shared context: what do we know about the business, the market, and the consumer that everyone in the room should agree on?',
      'The Complication introduces the tension: given this situation, what has changed, what is the challenge, or what opportunity are we not yet capturing?',
      'The Resolution is your recommendation: given the situation and the complication, here is what I propose we do — and here is why it will work.',
      'One common mistake I see in junior marketers is leading with the resolution before establishing the situation — which is why recommendations often get rejected: the audience doesn\'t share the "why."',
      'For example, I used SCR to present Mizone\'s H2 strategy: Situation — Mizone holds strong brand equity but is underperforming with Gen Z. Complication — two competitors are aggressively entering the Gen Z space this quarter. Resolution — we must accelerate our Gen Z digital strategy now, before the competitive window closes.',
      'A well-structured SCR presentation should be completable in three minutes — brevity and clarity are senior management\'s most appreciated gifts from a brand manager.',
      'The discipline of SCR thinking forces you to do the hard work of logic before you touch a single slide — and the result is presentations that are impossible to argue with.'

      'SCR框架——情境、复杂性、解决方案——是结构化商业演示的黄金标准，因为它反映了高管实际思考的方式。',

      '复杂性引入张力：鉴于这种情境，发生了什么变化，挑战是什么，或者我们尚未把握的机会是什么？',
      '解决方案是你的建议：鉴于情境和复杂性，这是我提议我们做的——以及为什么它会奏效。',
      '我在初级营销人员身上看到的一个常见错误是在建立情境之前就推进解决方案——这就是为什么建议经常被拒绝：受众不认同"原因"。',

      '一个结构良好的SCR演示应该可以在三分钟内完成——简洁和清晰是高级管理层最欣赏的品牌经理的礼物。',
      'SCR思维的纪律迫使你在接触任何幻灯片之前做好逻辑的艰难工作——结果是无懈可击的演示。'
