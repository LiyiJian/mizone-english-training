    text: [
      'The SCR framework — Situation, Complication, Resolution — is the gold standard for structured business presentations because it mirrors how executives actually think.',
      'In the Situation section, you establish shared context: what do we know about the business, the market, and the consumer that everyone in the room should agree on?',
      'The Complication introduces the tension: given this situation, what has changed, what is the challenge, or what opportunity are we not yet capturing?',
      'The Resolution is your recommendation: given the situation and the complication, here is what I propose we do — and here is why it will work.',
      'One common mistake I see in junior marketers is leading with the resolution before establishing the situation — which is why recommendations often get rejected: the audience doesn\'t share the "why."',
      'For example, I used SCR to present Mizone\'s H2 strategy: Situation — Mizone holds strong brand equity but is underperforming with Gen Z. Complication — two competitors are aggressively entering the Gen Z space this quarter. Resolution — we must accelerate our Gen Z digital strategy now, before the competitive window closes.',
      'A well-structured SCR presentation should be completable in three minutes — brevity and clarity are senior management\'s most appreciated gifts from a brand manager.',
      'The discipline of SCR thinking forces you to do the hard work of logic before you touch a single slide — and the result is presentations that are impossible to argue with.'

This gives us a solid foundation going into H2.\n\nComplication: However, Q2 brand tracking reveals a concerning trend: brand preference among 22–30-year-olds has dropped 5 percentage points (38% → 33%), our most critical growth segment. Simultaneously, Competitor Brand X has surged its Douyin share of voice by 25%, specifically targeting this cohort. Without intervention, we risk losing this segment\'s consideration permanently.\n\nResolution: I recommend a focused H2 counteroffensive:\n1. Douyin Content Offensive: 30 micro-KOL activations around "workday wellness" in Q3.\n2. WeChat Loyalty Reactivation: Targeted campaign to lapsed 22–30-year-old users.\n3. Gen Z Brand Voice Workshop: August positioning session to evolve our tone and messaging.\n\nIncremental Investment: RMB 3.2M (within existing H2 flexibility budget). Projected outcome: recover 3 ppts of brand preference by Q4.\n\nCould you please confirm alignment by [Date]? I\'m available for a brief call at your convenience.\n\nBest regards,\nXueyan Xu | Brand Manager, Mizone'

      'Complication: Two key competitors are aggressively targeting this exact segment — at precisely the moment Mizone\'s relevance among Gen Z is beginning to slip.',
      'Resolution: I recommend a three-pronged response — a Douyin micro-KOL offensive, a WeChat loyalty reactivation, and a Gen Z brand voice evolution — all executable within our existing H2 budget envelope.',

  quiz: {
    questions: [
      {
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'In the SCR framework, what does the "Complication" section introduce?',
        options: [
          'A summary of the brand\'s historical performance',
          'The tension, challenge, or change that disrupts the status quo and creates the need for action',
          'The detailed financial projections for the recommendation',
          'A description of competitor brands'
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: 'The Complication is the pivot point of an SCR presentation — it answers "so what?" by introducing the disruption that makes the status quo insufficient and your recommendation necessary.'
      },
      {
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'Why should the "Resolution" section come AFTER the "Situation" and "Complication" in an executive presentation?',
        options: [
          'Because it is the longest section and needs most time',
          'Because executives need to agree on the problem before they will accept a recommendation — shared context makes recommendations persuasive',
          'Because presenting the resolution first would confuse the audience',
          'Because finance teams always review costs before approving strategy'
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: 'Leading with the resolution without establishing context is the most common reason recommendations get rejected. The SCR sequence creates the logical "pull" that makes the recommendation feel inevitable.'

        question: 'A presentation structure that consists of Situation, Complication, and Resolution is commonly known as the ________ framework.',
        answer: 'SCR',
        explanation: 'The SCR (Situation-Complication-Resolution) framework, also known as the Minto Pyramid Principle, is the standard for structured executive communication in consulting and FMCG.'
      },
      {
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'A brand manager ends her presentation by saying: "I\'d like your alignment to proceed with Option A." This ending is considered best practice because:',
        options: [
          'It shows she is assertive and wants her way',
          'Every business presentation should end with a clear, explicit call to action that advances the decision or process',
          'It reduces the time needed for Q&A',
          'Senior leaders prefer direct demands over questions'
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: 'A clear call to action (CTA) at the end of a presentation transforms a "sharing session" into a decision moment — it respects senior leaders\' time by making the ask explicit and actionable.'

        answer: 'The situation is that our brand has strong awareness, but the complication is that we are losing preference among young people.',
        explanation: 'Errors: "is our brand" → "is that our brand" (noun clause needs "that"); "have" → "has" (singular verb); "prefer" → "preference" (noun form); "young peoples" → "young people" ("people" is already plural).'
